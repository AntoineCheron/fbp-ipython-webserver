## `public class ShellChannel extends JupyterChannel`

This class is used to create both the shell and control channels.

Shell: this single ROUTER socket allows multiple incoming connections from frontends, and this is the socket where requests for code execution, object information, prompts, etc. are made to the kernel by any frontend. The communication on this socket is a sequence of request/reply actions from each frontend and the kernel.

Control: This channel is identical to Shell, but operates on a separate socket, to allow important messages to avoid queueing behind execution requests (e.g. shutdown or abort).
